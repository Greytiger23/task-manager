# Task Manager

## 🔖 Project Title & Description
**Task Manager** is a full-stack web application designed to help individuals or teams manage their tasks efficiently. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating, organizing, and tracking tasks, as well as features for collaboration and productivity.

Users can create accounts, add tasks, assign them to team members, set due dates, and track their progress. The application also supports features like task prioritization, tagging, and notifications to help users stay organized and on top of their tasks.

This project matters because **everyone needs to manage their time effectively and stay organized**. Whether it's a personal task list or a team project, having a task manager helps individuals and teams keep track of their tasks, set priorities, and collaborate effectively.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
**Frontend**
- React (Next.js)
- Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI

**Backend**
- Supabse (Postgres + Auth + APIs)

**Database**
- PostgreSQl (via Supabase)

**Other Tools**
- React Testing Library (unit & integration tests)
- Trae / CodeRabbit (AI-assited coding & PR review)
- Github for version control

## 🧠 AI Integration Strategy

### 1. Code Generation
- Use AI to **scaffold React components** (e.g., `TaskForm`, `TaskList`, `TaskDetail`)
- Generate **API helper functions** for CRUD operations on tasks and user authentication (`createTask`, `getTasks`, `updateTask`, `deleteTask`, `login`, `register`)
- AI-powered IDE (e.g., Trae) will accelerate boilerplate generation, reducing development time and effort.

### 2. Testing
- AI will help **generate unit tests** with React Testing Library:
  - Example: *“Write tests to ensure `TaskForm` submits data correctly and validates required fields.”*
- **Integration tests** for Supabase API helpers will be drafted with AI prompts based on schema.

### 3. Documentation
- Use AI to create and maintain:
    - **Docstrings** in function and classes.
    - **Inline comments** for complex logic.
    - **README.md** file with project overview, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

### 4. Context-Aware Techniques
- Provide AI with **Supabase schema** to generate CRUD queries.  
- Share **file trees** to help AI suggest imports, module structures, and routing.  
- Feed **git diffs** into AI tools to generate commit messages and PR descriptions.

## 📅 Project Roadmap
1. **Setup & Scaffolding**: Initialize repo, configure Supabase, setup frontend.  
2. **Authentication**: Implement user signup/login.  
3. **Core Features**: Task CRUD operations with categories.  
4. **UI/UX Enhancements**: Styling with Tailwind + Shadcn, add responsive design.  
5. **Testing & Documentation**: Write unit tests, integration tests, and refine README/docs.  
6. **Optional Enhancements**: Deadlines, reminders, statistics dashboard.
